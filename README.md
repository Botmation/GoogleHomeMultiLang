# GoogleHomeMultiLang
This is a modified version of the google home assistant pushtotalk.py python sample code. This modification adds the capability to quicky switch between different languages by simply speaking a hotword assigned to that language. The code also uses speech recognition python library to replace the use of user click interaction with vocal activation.
